## Go Fundamentals



### Local Setup

For playing locally, the following settings were used:

```bash
export GOPATH=`pwd`
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
```

Based on these, we can compile and run using two simple commands (example for `functions` package):
```shell
$ go install functions   ## to compile and install it locally
$ ./bin/functions        ## to run the result
```
