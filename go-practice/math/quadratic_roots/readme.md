### Quadratic Equation


Implement the function `findRoots` to find the roots of the quadratic equation: ax2 + bx + c = 0. If the equation has only one solution, the function should return that solution as both results. The equation will always have at least one solution.

The roots of the quadratic equation can be found with the following formula:
