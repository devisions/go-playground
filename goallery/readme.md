### Run in dev mode

To "reload" the application when changes are detected, [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) tool is used. 
The config file is included in the project as `.air.conf` file.

To install the tool you can run `go get -u github.com/cosmtrek/air` being outside of this repo, 
as it's not a dependency to this module and you don't want to accidentally declare it as it actually is.

Then run `air` while being in the project directory.
